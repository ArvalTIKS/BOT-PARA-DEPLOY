<analysis>
The AI engineer's work trajectory began by expanding a single-tenant WhatsApp-to-OpenAI application into a multi-tenant platform. A critical misinterpretation occurred: instead of maintaining individual WhatsApp services per client (as initially intended by the user and partially supported by the backend model), the AI engineer implemented a *consolidated* WhatsApp service, routing all client traffic through a single instance. This led to persistent issues with independent client functionality, QR generation stability, and command execution. Repeated user feedback highlighted this architectural drift. The engineer has since been attempting to revert to the correct multi-tenant architecture with truly independent WhatsApp services per client, currently debugging issues related to the creation and stability of these individual client services, specifically with Chromium initialization and port conflicts in the newly generated client-specific Node.js instances.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was a web platform connecting a single WhatsApp account to an OpenAI assistant via QR code, focusing on automatic connection and real-time status. The user then mandated a **multi-tenant platform** featuring:
1.  A central **admin panel** for client management (add, list, activate/deactivate bots, email configuration).
2.  Automated email delivery of unique landing page links to each client.
3.  Dedicated **client-specific landing pages** displaying individual QR codes and bot status.
4.  Crucially, **each client must have an isolated WhatsApp service instance** connected to *their own unique WhatsApp number* on a distinct port (e.g., 3001, 3002). This was repeatedly emphasized by the user to avoid a shared number.
5.  Automatic conversation cleanup every 24 hours.
6.  Admin ability to connect/disconnect client bots.
7.  A feature to **pause/reactivate specific conversations** via WhatsApp commands (, , , , ), executable by both the bot owner and individual conversation participants (for specific conversations), with global commands (, ) implicitly for owner/admin knowledge.
8.  The bot should **not respond in WhatsApp groups**.
9.  The bot's response time needs to be optimized for speed.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Core Architecture Reversion:** The primary task is to fully restore the multi-tenant architecture where each client has a truly independent WhatsApp service running on its own unique port, rather than sharing a single consolidated service. This is currently in progress.
-   **Individual Service Stability:** Ensure newly generated client-specific WhatsApp services (e.g., on port 3002, 3003) launch stably, generate QRs, and process messages/commands correctly.
-   **Chromium Installation in Client Instances:** Resolve persistent  or related issues within the dynamically generated client WhatsApp service instances.

<current_work>
The immediate work is focused on rectifying the architectural deviation and establishing truly independent WhatsApp service instances for each client. The AI engineer previously (incorrectly) implemented a consolidated system, causing all clients to share a single WhatsApp connection (port 3001) despite the backend models assigning unique ports.

The current efforts involve:
1.  **Reverting :** The consolidated  and  (which forced all clients to use port 3001) have been removed, and  has been replaced with a version intended to create and manage individual Node.js processes for each client on their assigned unique ports (e.g., 3002, 3003).
2.  **Rewriting :** This file was completely rewritten to align with the individual client service architecture, fetching client-specific data.
3.  **Updating :** Changes were made to allow the admin panel to correctly interact with and control these new individual client services.
4.  **Debugging Individual Service Launch:** The AI is currently facing challenges in getting these *newly generated* client-specific WhatsApp service instances to launch and run successfully.
    *   Initial attempts revealed missing files () within the dynamically created client service directories.
    *   There were issues with the generated  still hardcoding port 3001.
    *   The latest problem identified is  within these new individual service environments, indicating  isn't correctly setting up its browser dependencies or  isn't accessible.
5.  **Attempting to Install Chromium per Service:** The very last action was yarn add v1.22.22

Done in 36.23s. within a specific client's service directory (). This implies an attempt to make each client's WhatsApp service self-sufficient in terms of its Chromium dependency.

The system is in a transitional state from a shared WhatsApp service back to the originally intended individual services, with ongoing debugging for the stability of these separate instances.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to diagnose why Chromium is not being found or correctly utilized by the newly installed puppeteer within the individual client WhatsApp service directory, and ensure the service launches and generates QR codes.
