The previous AI engineer initiated work to fix a WhatsApp bot application where QR codes weren't opening from emails. The trajectory reveals a complex debugging process primarily hindered by a fundamental disconnect between the AI's development environment and the user's production environment, causing fixes to not persist or apply correctly.

The AI initially diagnosed missing Chromium and implemented robust self-recovery mechanisms, including a new . A significant bug was identified and fixed where OpenAI Assistant API keys and IDs were not being correctly saved to the database, leading to generic bot responses.

Despite these code-level fixes, the user consistently reported issues in their deployed environment, leading to a frustrating loop of re-diagnosing similar problems (e.g., QR not appearing, bot not activating). The core issues revolved around  dependencies and Chromium executability not persisting in production, and a design flaw where new clients require manual Connect actions post-creation. The latest critical information from technical support reveals that the WhatsApp services are still hardcoded to  URLs, preventing them from functioning correctly in the deployed environment. This confirms the next critical fix.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a robust and scalable multi-tenant WhatsApp bot application. Each client should have an independent WhatsApp service and an OpenAI Assistant integration. The core functionality involves:
1.  **Client Creation:** Ability to create new clients via an admin panel, associating them with unique OpenAI API keys and Assistant IDs.
2.  **Email Invitation:** Clients receive an email with a unique link to their dedicated landing page.
3.  **QR Code Connection:** Upon visiting the landing page, a QR code should appear, allowing the client to scan it with their WhatsApp to connect their bot.
4.  **Automated Messaging:** Once connected, the bot should automatically process and respond to WhatsApp messages using the configured OpenAI Assistant.
5.  **Service Stability:** Services must be stable, auto-recovering from disconnections, and scalable to support multiple clients concurrently (up to 5 clients initially).
The user specifically highlighted issues where the QR code wasn't opening/appearing, the bot wasn't responding correctly (giving generic replies), and services were not activating or maintaining connection, especially in the production deployment environment. A critical design flaw identified is that the active status in the database doesn't automatically mean the WhatsApp service is running; manual connection from the admin panel is required.

-   :
    *   **Summary:** Node.js service for each WhatsApp client.
    *   **Changes:** Implemented robust reconnect logic, improved authentication failure handling, and added a  endpoint. The current core issue is that this service is likely hardcoding  URLs when deployed.

<pending_tasks>
-   User needs to confirm if current fixes (especially OpenAI credential saving) work in *their* production environment after the latest deploy.
-   Address the fundamental design issue: new clients marked active in the database still require manual Connect action from the admin panel to start their WhatsApp service.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most recent work involves debugging a critical discrepancy between the development environment (where fixes are applied) and the user's production deployment. Despite numerous code-level fixes, the user's deployed application consistently exhibits issues where QR codes don't appear and bots don't activate or respond correctly with their configured OpenAI Assistants.

The key fixes implemented include:
1.  **OpenAI Credential Handling:** Fixed a bug in  and  to ensure  and  are correctly saved and retrieved for new clients, preventing generic bot responses.
2.  **Robust URL System:** Introduced a new module  and updated , , , and  to dynamically determine application URLs for different environments (preview, production) with fallbacks.
3.  **Chromium/Dependency Installation:** Repeatedly installed Chromium and  dependencies (e.g., Reading package lists...

4.  **Service Recovery:** Created  to automatically monitor and restart crashed WhatsApp client services.

However, the user's Roberto client, created directly in their production deploy, still showed Service not running and the AI's diagnostic queries for that client resulted in 404: Client not found, strongly indicating **separate databases/environments**. The latest communication from Emergent Team (Chat 661) confirms a new, critical issue: the WhatsApp services are currently hardcoded to  and need to be implemented for the deployed website's actual URLs. This is the immediate problem preventing the application from working in production.
