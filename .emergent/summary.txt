The previous AI engineer's primary task was to develop a full-stack application connecting WhatsApp to an OpenAI assistant via a QR code. The core challenge, identified early on, was the persistent failure of the WhatsApp service (using , then ) to maintain a connection and generate QR codes in the Emergent production environment, despite working perfectly in the preview environment.

The engineer made numerous attempts to debug and fix this, including switching libraries, adjusting Puppeteer settings, implementing robust error handling, session cleaning, and auto-reconnection logic for WhatsApp. A significant focus was on correctly configuring environment variables and inter-service communication URLs, recognizing the difference between preview's single-container setup and deploy's separate containers. Despite multiple iterations and troubleshooting efforts, including official suggestions that later proved incorrect or incomplete, the deployment issue (WhatsApp service error: All connection attempts failed) remained unresolved due to underlying networking limitations in the Emergent platform.

Towards the end, the engineer pivoted to improving the local preview environment, successfully resolving OpenAI thread corruption issues and implementing automatic QR regeneration after disconnections. The latest work involved sanitizing hardcoded references to the old law firm name in the frontend and WhatsApp service to support a new client. The deploy problem persists, confirming it as an infrastructure limitation beyond code fixes.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a simple, single-view web platform to display a QR code for connecting a client's WhatsApp number to a specific OpenAI assistant (Estudio Jurídico Villegas Otárola Abogados, later updated to a new assistant ID).
Key requirements include:
*   **Automatic Connection:** The bot must be installed on the WhatsApp number to automatically answer messages.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The QR code and connection status must update dynamically.
*   **Simplicity:** A professional, single-page platform with no login, extra buttons, or editing features, displaying Escanee este código para activar su asistente.
*   **Responsive Design:** Functional on both mobile (iPhone) and desktop.
*   **Specific OpenAI Assistant:** Must connect to a particular OpenAI Assistant ID (, later ).
*   **No WhatsApp Business API:** Client explicitly forbade the official API.
*   **Existing Phone Number Usage:** The bot should ideally use the client's existing WhatsApp number, with a compromise implemented for command-based bot activation/suspension.
The main problem is ensuring the application functions correctly upon deployment, as it consistently fails there despite working in the preview environment.

<pending_tasks>
-   The core issue of the WhatsApp service failing to connect and generate QR codes in the Emergent production/deployed environment remains unresolved, despite extensive debugging and theoretical fixes.
-   The activar bot and suspender bot commands functionality, though implemented, cannot be fully verified in the production environment due to the primary connection issue.

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on resolving two main areas:
1.  **OpenAI Assistant Functionality:** The system was incorrectly returning a generic fallback message instead of actual AI responses. This was traced to corrupted OpenAI thread IDs stored in MongoDB which were not being validated against the OpenAI API. The  file was modified to include logic that attempts to retrieve a thread from OpenAI; if it's not found (Error 404), it deletes the corrupted thread ID from MongoDB and creates a new one, ensuring fresh conversation threads for each user. This fix was verified to work correctly in the preview environment.
2.  **WhatsApp Service Recovery (Preview):** The WhatsApp service was observed to fail in generating a new QR code after a disconnection (e.g., unlinking from the phone), reporting a 401 Unauthorized or Connection Failure error. The  file was modified to implement an automatic recovery mechanism. This mechanism now detects 401 errors or Connection Failure messages, automatically deletes the  session directory to clear corrupted session data, and then re-initializes the WhatsApp client to generate a new QR code without manual intervention. This auto-recovery was also successfully verified in the preview environment.
3.  **Hardcoded Text Removal:** The frontend and WhatsApp service contained hardcoded references to the previous client (Estudio Jurídico Villegas Otárola). These were updated in , , and  to be generic (su asistente or removed entirely) to accommodate a new client.
Despite these significant improvements to the preview environment and the underlying code logic, the fundamental problem of the WhatsApp service failing to establish and maintain a connection in the *deployed* Emergent environment (resulting in WhatsApp service error: All connection attempts failed on the deployed URL) persists and is confirmed to be an infrastructure-level networking issue.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the updated hardcoded text changes in the preview environment to ensure all client-specific references have been generalized.
