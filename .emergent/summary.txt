The previous AI engineer initially focused on debugging a WhatsApp-to-OpenAI application, primarily struggling with persistent connection failures in the production environment (Emergent platform) despite local functionality. This was identified as an infrastructure limitation. The scope then dramatically expanded to a multi-tenant platform, enabling distinct OpenAI assistants and WhatsApp numbers per client. The engineer successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-tenant architecture including an admin panel, unique client landing pages, dynamic service provisioning, and conversation management (pause/reactivate). Significant efforts were made to resolve email delivery issues in deployment, transitioning from Bluehosting SMTP (blocked by MailChannels) to a working Gmail SMTP setup. While the core multi-tenant platform is functional and stable for moderate usage, the dynamic per-client WhatsApp service instances remain unstable, leading to reliance on a single, shared WhatsApp service for QR generation.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was a single-view web platform to connect a client's WhatsApp to a specific OpenAI assistant via QR code, emphasizing automatic connection, real-time status updates, simplicity, responsiveness, and using  (later ) without the official WhatsApp Business API. The primary problem was consistent deployment failure.

The user subsequently requested a **multi-tenant platform** with:
*   A central **admin panel** to add new clients, providing their OpenAI API Key, Assistant ID, and email.
*   Ability to send an automated email with a unique link to each client's dedicated landing page.
*   A **client-specific landing page** displaying connection status and a QR code for their unique bot instance.
*   Each client's WhatsApp service should be isolated () and connectable to only one phone.
*   Automatic conversation cleanup every 24 hours.
*   Admin ability to connect/disconnect client bots from the panel.
*   A new feature to **pause/reactivate specific conversations** from the client's WhatsApp (via commands like pausar, reactivar, pausar todo, activar todo, estado) without requiring the client to input phone numbers.

<pending_tasks>
-   The dynamic, per-client WhatsApp service instances are not fully stable, leading to reliance on the single, shared WhatsApp service for QR generation.
-   The activar bot and suspender bot commands functionality (for the overall bot, not specific conversations) needs to be re-verified in the production environment.
-   The overall deployment status, especially QR code generation and email sending, needs final verification from the user in their actual deployed environment.

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on demonstrating the full functionality of the newly implemented multi-tenant platform and resolving critical deployment issues.

1.  **Multi-Tenant Platform Verification:** The AI successfully created multiple test clients, verified the admin panel's ability to list and manage them (activate/deactivate, edit/resend email, delete), and confirmed the client-specific landing pages functioned correctly, displaying the unique client name, service status, and QR generation status.
2.  **Email System Debugging & Resolution:** The most significant challenge was email delivery in the deployed environment. Initially, emails sent from  via Bluehosting's SMTP were blocked by MailChannels due to an Account blocked error. The AI diagnosed this as an external MailChannels issue. To resolve this without user intervention, the system was reconfigured to send emails from  using Gmail's SMTP server, requiring the user to provide a Gmail app password. This was successfully implemented and verified, with emails now sending correctly.
3.  **Conversation Pause/Reactivate Feature Implementation:** A key new feature, allowing clients to pause/reactivate specific WhatsApp conversations using simple commands (pausar, reactivar, pausar todo, activar todo, estado), was implemented. This involved adding a new database model (), modifying message processing logic in  and , and adding new API endpoints. This feature was thoroughly tested and confirmed to work as expected, pausing responses for specific chats and reactivating them.
4.  **WhatsApp QR Generation Discrepancy:** While the multi-tenant architecture *supports* dynamic WhatsApp services per client, the  running for individual client instances (e.g., on port 3003) was noted as unstable in generating QRs. As a workaround for user testing, the AI directed the user to the legacy page (which uses the main  on port 3001) for QR scanning, ensuring the core WhatsApp-AI connection functioned with the *user's specific assistant ID* after dynamic configuration. The AI also successfully diagnosed and fixed a  error, ensuring the  could generate QRs.
5.  **Deployment Verification:** The AI prepared for deployment verification, but the user needed to trigger the deployment process manually. Once deployed, the AI aims to confirm full functionality (backend API, WhatsApp QR, admin panel, landing pages, email system) in the production environment.

The platform is now feature-complete with multi-tenancy, email, and conversation control, but the stability of *individual* WhatsApp instances per client remains an underlying technical concern that needs future optimization if scaling beyond moderate usage.
